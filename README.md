💡 Recommendations

 Consider Geographic Trends
Insight: Consistently high average prices in certain areas may reflect higher-income demographics or localized demand trends.

Recommendation: Conduct further analysis to identify correlations between price trends and factors like income, population density

Evaluate Regional Expansion

Insight: Higher-priced zip codes may indicate untapped potential in surrounding areas with similar demographics.

Recommendation: Explore expansion opportunities in neighboring zip codes with comparable profiles to maximize growth potential.
